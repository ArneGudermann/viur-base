# ViUR base

**viur-base** provides a basic ViUR project structure.

This is the best place to start a new ViUR 3 project from!

---

## Usage

To setup your new ViUR project, perform these steps:

1. `git clone https://github.com/viur-framework/viur-base.git YOUR-PROJECT`
2. `cd YOUR-PROJECT`
3. `git checkout viur3`
4. `./clean-base.py -A YOUR-APP-ID`
5. `./viur-gcloud-setup.sh YOUR-APP-ID` (this step will be improved later!)


When finished, your repository is disconnected from [viur-base](https://github.com/viur-framework/viur-base) as its origin, and can be configured to point to another origin where your new project lives in future. It still contains the full history of the base repository. This might be wanted or not. Do `find . -name .git -exec rm -rf {} \;` to drop the entire history and start over setting up a clean project with `git init`.

### Switch sub-modules to SSH

**WARNING: Not updated to ViUR 3 right now!!!**

Especially in ViUR development projects or for customer projects created at [Mausbrand](https://www.mausbrand.de/en) that are heavily involved in changes to server and vi, it is necessary to change the HTTPS submodules to SSH. This can easily be done for all submodules and their submodules with these few commands:

```bash
# change server
pushd deploy/server
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:viur-framework/server.git
popd

# change vi
pushd vi
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:viur-framework/vi.git
cd html5
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:viur-framework/html5.git
cd ../public/icons
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:viur-framework/icons.git
popd

# change ignite
pushd sources/less/ignite
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:viur-framework/ignite.git
popd
```

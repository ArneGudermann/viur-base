# ViUR base

**base** is the ViUR project structure basic repository.

## About

This repository works both as a base structure for new projects created with ViUR, and serves a possibility to generate the quick start ``setup.py`` script, which helps to quickly setup an empty, new ViUR project without any compromises.

### Using the repository

Download or clone the base repository including its submodules into a new directory of your choice.

When cloning, don't forget to change the remote origin path:

```
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
```

### Generating a setup.py

To generate a new setup.py, just call the script ``mksetup.py`` like this:

```
python mksetup.py >setup.py
```

The setup.py can than be distributed to easily setup new projects from the contents of the ``deploy/`` folder. It automatically downloads the latest ViUR server and pre-compiled vi from the ViUR website to immediatelly provide a running project.

## Cleaning up with clean-base.py
To make sure that the placeholders in app.yaml and viur_server.py are properly replaced and that you won't accidentally overwrite the viur-base repo, use the included clean-base.py script:

You need to enter an author name and an app ID to identify your app for later deployment and to be able to run the dev_appserver locally.
The script will also initialize and update the submodules and untether the app from the viur-base repository.

```
python clean-base.py
```

# ViUR base

**base** provides a basic project structure to start a new ViUR project.

## About

This repository works both as a base structure for new projects created with ViUR, and serves a possibility to generate the quick start ``setup.py`` script, which helps to rapidly setup an empty, new ViUR project without any compromises.

### How to use this repository

It is recommended to clone the base repository including its submodules into a new directory of your choice.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/viur-framework/base.git your-project
cd your-project
```

Then, to make sure that the placeholders in `app.yaml` and `viur_server.py` are properly replaced and that you won't accidentally overwrite the viur-base repo, use the included `clean-base.py` script.

You need to enter an author name and an app ID to identify your app for later deployment and to be able to run the `dev_appserver.py` locally.

The script will also initialize and update the submodules and disconnect the repo from the viur-base repository origin.

```bash
python clean-base.py
```

### Switch sub-modules to SSH

Especially in ViUR development projects or for projects at Mausbrand that are heavily involved in changes to server and vi, it is necessary to change the HTTPS submodules to SSH. This can easily be done for all submodules and their submodules with these few commands:

```bash
# change server
pushd deploy/server
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:viur-framework/server.git
popd

# change vi
pushd vi
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:viur-framework/vi.git
cd html5
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:viur-framework/html5.git
cd ../public/icons
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:viur-framework/icons.git
popd

# change ignite
pushd ignite
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:viur-framework/ignite.git
popd
```

### Generating a setup.py

To generate a new `setup.py`, just call the script ``mksetup.py`` like this:

```bash
python mksetup.py >setup.py
```

The setup.py can than be distributed to easily setup new projects from the contents of the ``deploy/`` folder. It automatically downloads the latest ViUR server and pre-compiled vi from the ViUR website to immediately provide a running project.

This folder currently is a work in progress.

1. Initialize and update all submodules
2. Run `get-pyodide.py` to download and extract latest pyodide binaries
3. Run `python3 gen_files_json.py` inside this directory to re-generate `files.json`, which contains all files the vi depends on.

The entire process will be optimized.
